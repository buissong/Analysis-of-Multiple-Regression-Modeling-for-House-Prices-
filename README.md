# Analysis-of-Multiple-Regression-Modeling-for-House-Prices-
In this project, I tackled the complex real estate market of Dallas by constructing a sophisticated regression model aimed at accurately predicting house prices. Starting with a robust dataset from Redfin, my initial focus was on data integrity, ensuring the cleanliness and relevance of the information fed into the model. This involved strategic binning based on mean prices to simplify the landscape into interpretable segments, aligning closely with real market distinctions.

I identified critical variables like square footage, bedrooms, and baths, which historically influence pricing, and meticulously prepared the data, filtering out anomalies and addressing missing values to ensure robustness in subsequent analysis. The model took shape through multiple regression techniques, employing Standard Least Squares to draw meaningful correlations between the selected variables and house prices.

As I delved deeper, I uncovered significant predictors, such as the interaction effects of baths with square footage, which unveiled nuanced insights into the premium placed on larger, amenity-rich properties. To ensure the model's assumptions held, I conducted a thorough residual analysis, investigating homoscedasticity and the normal distribution of residuals, which are critical for the model's predictive accuracy.

With the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, I minimized discrepancies between observed and predicted values. Diagnostic plots from JMP software were crucial for assessing the residuals' distribution, guiding adjustments to the model for better fidelity. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis was another pillar of my methodology, safeguarding against multicollinearity that could compromise the model's integrity.

The culmination of this meticulous process was a predictive model with an emphasis on forecasting rather than interpretation. Applying a log transformation to stabilize variance, I arrived at a model that captured the nuances of Dallas's housing market with an R-squared that indicated a high level of explanatory power.

This comprehensive approach went beyond crafting a statistical model; it was a fusion of domain expertise, statistical rigor, and a quest for predictive clarity. The findings not only serve as a testament to the power of data analytics in real-world applications but also lay the groundwork for future models that could adapt to the ever-changing variables of real estate economics.
